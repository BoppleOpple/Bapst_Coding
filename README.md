# Code Organization
If you want to share any of your code, either to help ofther people learn from it, or to ask for  advice on how to improve it, I suggest you upload it here, so anybody who is stuck with a specific problem can look to others' projects for help. If you want to do that, this is a guide for how to do so.
## Coding Problems
Find the folder for that problem (e.g. `Projects/Python/ProjectName`, or `Projects/C++/ProjectName`) and make a folder with your code & any other files. For example, the file system could look like this: `Projects/Python/ProjectName/LiamHillery/arraySorting.py` (This is liable to change, considering it's a little messy right now.)
## General Code
If you have your own project, if you wish, you can upload it here as well. This can be to share your work, to ask for help, or just to save it here. For example, If I wanted to share a project, I would just upload the folder to `Personal Code/LiamHillery/MyProject`.
