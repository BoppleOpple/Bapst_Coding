# Code Organization
If you want to share any of your code, either to help ofther people learn from it, or to ask for  advice on how to improve it, I suggest you upload it here, so anybody who is stuck with a specific problem can look to others' projects for help. If you want to do that, this is a guide for how to do so.
## Coding Problems
Find the folder for that problem (e.g. `Projects/Python/ProjectName`, or `Projects/C++/ProjectName`) and make a folder with your code & any other files. For example, the file system could look like this: `Projects/Python/ProjectName/LiamHillery/arraySorting.py` (This is liable to change, considering it's a little messy right now.)
## General Code
If you have your own project, if you wish, you can upload it here as well. This can be to share your work, to ask for help, or just to save it here. For example, If I wanted to share a project, I would just upload the folder to `Personal Code/LiamHillery/MyProject`.
# ACSL Schedule & materials
## Materials
Mostly just the ASCL [website](https://adventofcode.com) and [wiki](https://www.categories.acsl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) articles.
## Schedule / Order of Topics to learn:
**Most of the resources for these are in the wiki link above, and the topics are ripped straight from it.**
1. What Does This Program Do? (Learning ACSL's Pseudo-code and probably a little bit about comments)
2. Recursive Functions
3. Boolean Algebra
4. Computer Number Systems (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal)
5. [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) (Basically flow charts for computers)
6. LISP (***LIS***t ***P***rocessing language, This could be either very fun or very difficult, depending on what you like doing. Sort of high-end assembly or basic.)
7. [Digital Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) (Getting into reading electrical outputs according to Wikepedia, but ASCL doesn't say exactly what they do with it.)
8. Assembly Language (Theory, not the actual language)
9. Computer Data Structures ([This](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) resource seems to be good from past experience, but it is a bit too in-depth for a first exposure in my opinion.)
10. Bit-String Flicking (Binary, using lots of stuff from the Data Structures section)
11. Prefix/Infix/Postfix Notation (Different ways to write expressions)
